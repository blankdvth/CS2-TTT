# CS2-TTT

A Trouble in Terrorist Town plugin for CS2, made using CounterStrikeSharp.

## Requirements
- CSSharp >= v142

## Features


## Planned
- Modularity (similar to original ttt.inc)
- Localization
  - Allow customization of prefix as well
- Visual indication for traitor teammates
- Logging system
- RDM manager
- Shop

## Note
This plugin is currently very basic, including only the bare essentials for TTT to function. There is no timeline for
additional functionality, although suggestions & pull requests are always welcome. My experience with C# is minimal, so
style & best practices suggestions are also welcome.

You may use this plugin on your servers if you choose. Please ensure that you adhere to the
[GNU GPLv3 LICENSE](LICENSE). **Especially** if you are making changes.
